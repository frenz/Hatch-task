# Hatch studio - Task

Write a small program in Go that accepts 2 json files and prints out if they are equal.

## Notes

1. json files could consist of a single json object or a list of json objects.

2. sorting of the json objects or the keys inside the json object does not matter for equality.

3. you have the freedom to use any pkg if any and structure it as you wish.

4. sizes of input files can vary from couple of lines to gigabytes

## Example of equal jsons

1. 

```
[{
	"id":"jhasdad",
	"name":"test json"
},
{
	"id":"wqweq",
	"name":"test json 2"
}]
```

2. 
```
[{
	"id":"wqweq",
	"name":"test json 2"
},
{
	"name":"test json",
	"id":"jhasdad"
}]
```

## Conditions
